# Chaos Mesh

One of the requirements is to be 

> able to withstand the loss of a single application component

To fulfil this, I chose two key methods.
- Container orchestration
- [Chaos Engineering](https://en.wikipedia.
org/wiki/Chaos_engineering).

Chaos Engineering this ensures that distributed systems are able to 
withstand unexpected disruptions. One could think about it as asking someone to purposefully and 
randomly trigger an avalanche to test your avalanche defences.

## Decision-making Process

There are many Chaos engineering tools that are designed for Kubernetes, including but not 
limited to,
- [chaosk8s](https://chaostoolkit.org/drivers/kubernetes/)
- [Chaos Mesh](https://chaos-mesh.org/)
- [Gremlin](https://www.gremlin.com/)

Ultimately, [Chaos Mesh](https://chaos-mesh.org/) was chosen because it is,
- supported by the CNCF
- open source (Apache-2.0)
-
