# TDD FTW
[Test Driven Development](https://www.obeythetestinggoat.com/) is vital and used extensively throughout.

> When should we test? All the @Â£%&! time

## Python

The [pytest framework](https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.2.x/) is used to test all Python code. This was chosen over the built-in 
[unittest framework](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html) due to,
- popularity
- ease of use

## Configuration

The [Conftest utility](https://www.conftest.dev/) is used to test all configuration management, including but not limited to 
Terraform, Kubernetes and more. This was chosen because it is,
- one tool that can test multiple configuration types
